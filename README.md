# Oracle RPG Character Sheet for TaleSpire

We're building [a simple tabletop RPG system](https://oracle-rpg.com/) to play by yourself or a friend, and [Talespire](https://talespire.com/) is a fantastic tool to use with our system to set up a game board.

Talespire's modding system is called Symbiotes and uses a Chromium embedded browser which allows programmers like myself to create web apps to embed in the game with ease.

## How to use this Symbiote in Talespire
This Symbiote is built with Vue 3 + Vite as a build tool. To get started, clone this repo, cd into it and run `npm install`. 
You need to have Node.js version 14.18+, 16+ installed on your system. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.
